<div class="row2"><p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game for two teams of 11 players, where the batting team scores runs by hitting a bowled ball and running between wickets, while the fielding team tries to dismiss the batters and prevent runs. The game has a governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC), and its rules are known as the "Laws of Cricket", maintained by the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). Key aspects include the objective of scoring more runs, dismissals, runs for boundaries (four or six), and the different formats of the game. <a href="https://www.rulesofsport.com/sports/cricket.html">for the full rules click here</a></p> <div class="imgg"><img src="crick.png" alt="cricket" width="700"></div></div>
