<div class="row2"><p>In basketball, two teams aim to score by shooting a ball through the opposing team's hoop, which is 10 feet high. Points are scored as 1 for a free throw, 2 for a field goal inside the 3-point line, and 3 for a successful shot from behind the 3-point line. Players must dribble or pass the ball to advance it, and the game starts with a tip-off. Possession changes after a score or foul, and play is governed by rules on violations like traveling or double-dribbling, and fouls, where a player receives a free throw. <a href="https://nz.basketball/get-involved/officials-hub/the-rules-2/">full rules here</a></a></p> <div class="imgg"><img src="basket.jpeg" alt="basketball1" width="650"></div></div>
